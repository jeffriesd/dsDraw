# dsDraw

dsDraw is an interactive tool for creating videos with flowcharts and data structures, with an emphasis on programmatic drawing. The user can interact with the canvas by point-and-click or by entering command via the console. These interactions can be recorded along with audio from the user's microphone to create dynamic content.

## Editing the canvas  
The canvas can be edited before and during recording, so the user may 'set the scene' with some objects or text before recording begins. 

Different independent clips can be created either from the current contents of the canvas or from a blank canvas. The user can switch between these clips, editing and recording over them. 

## Saving a video  
Once video has been recorded for a clip, it is no longer editable. Recorded videos may be merged with other clips and exported as .webm files.

## Basic mouse controls
To __move__ an existing object, hold control and drag the object.  
To __clone__ an existing object, hold alt and drag the object.  
To __delete__ any object, click on it to bring up the options and click the red X.   
To change the settings of an existing object, click on it
and select new options or configure it from the console.
The currently selected object(s) will have a bright blue border.
